# Inheritance
* Relates to the value of a property if nothing is specifically defined for it.
* Every property can have inheritance categorized in 2 ways
  1. Inherited: From the parent element
  2. Non-inherited:
* Some things inherit from **their** parent **objects**, others dont
  * EG, colour is inherited by all children.
  * Border is not.
