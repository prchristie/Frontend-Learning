  Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait.

  <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
  <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

  <li>
    Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
    heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
    paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1
    teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered,
    for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
    boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.

    parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
