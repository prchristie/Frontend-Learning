# Box model
* Everything displayed by CSS is a box
* Things that appear as a circle are really a box with some attributes

## Content and sizing
* The boxes look and behave differently based on attributes on them
* They can contain more boxes, text, imgs, etc.
  * Content effects the size of the box inherently
  * Make box the size we want by extrinsically sizing (choosing its dimensions.)
    * Letting browser do it = intrinsic sizing
